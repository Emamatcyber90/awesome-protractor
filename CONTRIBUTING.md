# Contributing to Awesome Protractor

We love pull requests from everyone. We only ask 2 things: that you ensure the suggested resource is _awesome_, and be kind to everyone involved.

## Step-by-step

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/awesome-protractor.git`
3. Make your change
4. Push to your fork
5. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

After step 5, you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. The maintainers reserve the right to reject any resource that we conclude does not add new information, or does not adhere to the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
